        <h3>School</h3>
        <div id="container"><img src="images/cca.jpg" id="cca">
        <p>I am currently a sophomore at <a href="https://sduhsd.net" target="_blank"> Canyon Crest Academy</a>. Despite the increased pressure due to being a sophomore now, I have managed to maintain a 4.0 unweighted GPA. In addition to my required classes, I have taken classes in Spanish, which I have been taking Spanish since middle school and therefore completed Spanish 3 in CCA, Orchestra, which I took for my art class requirement, AP Psychology, as I have always been interested in psychology, and <span class="highlight">AP Computer Science, for which I am making this website.</span> Outside the academic portion of school, the social portion of my school life is enjoyable. I hang out with my friends during lunch, or with several whom I met through math I do math with, of which I will elaborate on.</p></body></div>
        
        <h3>Math</h3>
        <div id="container"><img src="images/math.jpg" id="math">
        <div id="sidebar"><h3>Math Competitions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8th grade Mathcounts SoCal state round: 6th individually, 4th place countdown round, 1st place team</li>
                <li>7th grade BmMT: 1st place team; 8th grade BmMT: 3rd place team (there were thrice as many people as the previous year)</li>
                <li>7th and 8th grade ARML San Diego Team 2, 9th grade ARML San Diego Team 1</li>
                <li>High school competitions: Berkeley Math Tournament (BMT), Stanford Math Tournament (SMT), Harvard-MIT Math Tournament (HMMT), and American Regions Mathematics League (ARML)</li>
            </ul>
        </div><p>Math is a large part of my life, and has been so since 3rd grade. I took AoPS courses like any other Asian child who was made to by their parents, and as I paid attention to the classes <span class="highlight">I qualified for the AIME</span> (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) <span class="highlight">in 6th grade.</span> Because of this, I decided to go into competition math, and in middle school, I competed in Mathcounts and the Berkeley mini Math Tournament (BmMT) at UC Berkeley. Now in high school I have also been participating in many competitions such as BMT, SMT, HMMT, ARML, for which CCA's math team or the San Diego Math Circle fly to Boston or San Francisco. I've also won some <a href="https://maa.org/student-programs/youth-program-awards-winners/" target="_blank">awards</a> from the American Mathematics Competitions (AMCs) and other competitions I have mentioned above.</p></div>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <div id="container"><img src="images/duet.jpg" id="music">
        <p>Music is also an extracurricular I’ve been involved in, though not approached with the same enthusiasm as math. I’ve been playing piano since 4 years old and violin since I was 7. I have put a lot of effort into piano and have therefore progressed to <span class="bold">MTAC Panel Level</span> after completing Level 10, and won state, national, and international competitions. In contrast, I have not put much effort into violin and therefore am currently at an intermediate level, at which I am not good enough to participate in competitions. Adding to my various piano accolades, I have for winning first prize in a <a href="https://www.goldenclassicalmusicawards.com/2025-la-winnerscompetition" target="_blank">competition</a> been invited to perform at Disney Hall, and I have performed in charity concerts organized by my piano teacher in partnership with a children’s cancer charity.</p></div>
