        <h2>My life in short summary</h2></div>

        <h3>School</h3>
        <div id="container"><img src="images/cca.jpg" id="cca">
        <p>I am currently a sophomore at <a href="https://sduhsd.net" target="_blank"> Canyon Crest Academy</a>. Despite the increased pressure due to being a sophomore now, I have managed to maintain a 4.0 unweighted GPA. In addition to my required classes, I have taken classes in Spanish, which I have been taking Spanish since middle school and therefore completed Spanish 3 in CCA, Orchestra, which I took for my art class requirement, AP Psychology, as I have always been interested in psychology, and AP Computer Science, for which I am making this website. Outside the academic portion of school, the social portion of my school life is enjoyable. I hang out with my friends during lunch, or with several whom I met through math I do math with, of which I will elaborate on.</p></body></div>
        
        <h3>Math</h3>
        <div id="container"><img src="images/math.jpg" id="math">
        <div id="sidebar"><h3>Math Competitions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I'll put stuff here</li>
                <li>tomorrow when I have the time</li>
            </ul>
        </div><p>Math is a large part of my life, and has been so since 3rd grade, which is when I first took AoPS courses like any other Asian child who was made to by their parents, and as I paid attention to the classes I managed to qualify for AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) in 6th grade. Because of this, I decided to go into competition math, and in middle school (7-8 grades), I competed in Mathcounts, in which I placed 6th individually, 4th place countdown round, and 1st place team in the state round for southern California. I also competed in the Berkeley mini Math Tournament (BmMT) at UC Berkeley, for which my team won first place in 7th grade, and 3rd place in 8th due to there being thrice as many teams as the previous year. Now in high school I have also been participating in many competitions such as Berkeley Math Tournament (BMT), Stanford Math Tournament (SMT), Harvard-MIT Math Tournament (HMMT), and American Regions Mathematics League (ARML), for which CCA's math team or the San Diego Math Circle fly to Boston or San Francisco. I've also won some <a href="https://maa.org/student-programs/youth-program-awards-winners/awards" target="_blank">awards</a> from the American Mathematics Competitions (AMCs) and other competitions I have mentioned above.</p></div>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <div id="container"><img src="images/duet.jpg" id="music">
        <p>Music is also an extracurricular I’ve been involved in, though not approached with the same enthusiasm as math. I’ve been playing piano since 4 years old and violin since I was 7. I have put a lot of effort into piano and have therefore won competitions through it. In contrast, I have not put much effort into violin and therefore am currently at an intermediate level, at which I am not good enough to participate in competitions. Adding to my various piano accolades, I have for winning first prize in a <a href="https://www.goldenclassicalmusicawards.com/2025-la-winnerscompetition" target="_blank">competition</a> been invited to perform at Disney Hall, and I have performed in charity concerts organized by my piano teacher in partnership with a children’s cancer charity.</p></div>
